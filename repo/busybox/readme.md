# BusyBox 


BusyBox is a lightweight utility that combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It is ideal for crafting space-efficient distributions, particularly for small or embedded systems. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a BusyBox container manually using Docker.


## Install

    apt-docker install busybox myname

    # Parameters
    --apt-docker-name="busybox-container"
    --bb-tag="latest"
    --data-dir="$HOME/.apt-docker/"
    --port="8080"
    --ip-mode="local"

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of Docker and command line
## Step-by-step Guide
### Step 1: Pull the BusyBox image from Docker Hub

Choose the desired BusyBox variant and pull the image from Docker Hub. In this example, we will use the `busybox:musl` variant:

```bash
docker pull busybox:musl
```


### Step 2: Create a new Docker container

Run the following command to create a new Docker container using the BusyBox image:

```bash
docker run -it --name my_busybox busybox:musl
```



This command creates a new container named `my_busybox` and drops you into an `sh` shell inside the container.
### Step 3: Explore BusyBox utilities

Once inside the container, you can run various BusyBox utilities. For example, to list files in the current directory, you can run:

```bash
ls
```



To check the available disk space, run:

```bash
df
```


### Step 4: Exit the BusyBox container

To exit the BusyBox container, run:

```bash
exit
```


### Step 5: Commit the changes (optional)

If you made any changes to the container and would like to save them as a new image, run the following command:

```bash
docker commit my_busybox my_busybox_image
```



This command creates a new image named `my_busybox_image` from the `my_busybox` container.
## Conclusion

You have now successfully set up a BusyBox container manually using Docker. You can further customize the container by adding your own utilities or modifying existing ones according to your needs. Remember to refer to the [BusyBox documentation](https://www.busybox.net/docs/)  for more information on the available utilities and their usage.
